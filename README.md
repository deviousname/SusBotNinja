# SusBotNinja
Newest SusBot flavour... I would say it taste like a ninja, but ninjas are faster than taste itself.


# -------
    Written for Python 3.8.10 on Windows 10
# -------
    download and unzip susbot-ocean-edition
    open your command prompt
    navigate to the unzipped susbot folder in your command prompt
    type:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    if pip is not recognized, then reinstall python 3.8
    and ensure you click Add to PATH during the install process

# -------
    After all the libraries are installed you can double-click
    Susbot_Ocean_Edition_.py to run it, it will open pixelplace
    then you should log in to pixelplace, and once you do
    it will detect that you are logged in and the hotkeys will turn
    on and display the controls in the console that opened.
